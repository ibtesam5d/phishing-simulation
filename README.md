## Mastercard Cybersecurity Job Simulation - Phishing Email Simulation Test and Awareness Training
# Summary
This is a phishing simulation test project report. Security team investigated a successful phishing email and created a benign phishing email based on the investigation for the employees of Mastercard to identify which departments are most vulnerable to phishing. Simulated email was created with a believable context and structure. Goal was to create an email that has the highest malicious link click-through rate and successful phishing rate. Analysis shows that the HR and Marketing department is most vulnerable to phishing attacks where the HR has the highest click-through rate and phishing success rate of 85% and 75% respectively. As a response, the security team created an awareness training for the employees to educate them on how to identify phishing emails and steps to follow to prevent future attacks.
